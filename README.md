2. BestAPI API tests 

let's begin with facebook 
we have an api Endpoint that creates a test user (Both on GUI and API level 
the test user email is generated by facebook, they don't offer a way to add a mail of my choice)

login page, a file for common setup of tests,
We have Test class that contains test cases for the login
